## **Quick Start**

### Install
Simply copy the code into your project or use npm
```shell
npm install nmea-web
```

### Usage
```typescript
import { parseNmeaSentence, GGAPacket, RMCPacket } from "nmea-web";

// Sample NMEA sentences
const ggaSentence = "$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47";
const rmcSentence = "$GPRMC,123519,A,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,022.4,084.4,230394,003.1,W*6A";

// Parse GGA sentence
const ggaPacket = parseNmeaSentence(ggaSentence) as GGAPacket;
console.log("GGA Packet:", ggaPacket);

// Parse RMC sentence
const rmcPacket = parseNmeaSentence(rmcSentence) as RMCPacket;
console.log("RMC Packet:", rmcPacket);

// Access specific fields
console.log(`Latitude: ${ggaPacket.latitude}, Longitude: ${ggaPacket.longitude}`);
console.log(`Heading (Track True): ${rmcPacket.trackTrue}`);
```

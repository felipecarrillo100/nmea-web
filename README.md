## **Features**

### **üöÄ Lightweight and Fast**
- Designed for modern web applications, this library is optimized for **performance** and **low overhead**.
- Zero dependencies‚Äîjust plug and play!

### **üåê Built for the Web**
- Perfect for browser-based environments. No extra setup or bulky libraries required.

### **üì° Supported NMEA Sentences**
- **GGA**: Global Positioning System Fix Data  
  Extract vital GPS data such as:
  - Time (UTC)
  - Latitude and Longitude
  - Fix Type (No Fix, GPS Fix, DGPS Fix)
  - Satellites in View
  - Altitude (meters)
  - Geoidal Separation
  - Differential GPS Data (optional)

- **RMC**: Recommended Minimum Specific GPS/Transit Data  
  Parse essential navigation details:
  - Date and Time (UTC)
  - Latitude and Longitude
  - Speed (knots)
  - Track True (heading in degrees)
  - Magnetic Variation
  - FAA Mode Indicator

### **üîß Intuitive API**
- Simple function calls to parse NMEA sentences into structured objects.
- Handles optional fields gracefully, ensuring robust performance even with incomplete data.
- **Optional checksum validation**: Validate the checksum of NMEA sentences, or disable it for faster parsing when working with trusted data sources.

### **üìñ Compact and Minimalistic**
- No unnecessary features or bloated functionality‚Äîfocus on what matters most.
- Lightweight footprint for seamless integration into your web browser projects.

## **Quick Start**

### Install
Simply copy the code into your project or use npm
```shell
npm install nmea-web
```

## Usage
```typescript
import { parseNmeaSentence, NmeaPacket, GGAPacket, RMCPacket } from "nmea-web";

// Example NMEA sentence
const sentence = "$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47";

// Parse the NMEA sentence
const packet = parseNmeaSentence(sentence) as NmeaPacket;

// Detect the packet type and handle accordingly
if (packet.type === "GGA") {
  const ggaPacket = packet as GGAPacket; // Typecast to GGAPacket
  console.log("This is a GGA Packet:");
  console.log(`Latitude: ${ggaPacket.latitude}, Longitude: ${ggaPacket.longitude}`);
  console.log(`Altitude: ${ggaPacket.altitude} meters`);
} else if (packet.type === "RMC") {
  const rmcPacket = packet as RMCPacket; // Typecast to RMCPacket
  console.log("This is an RMC Packet:");
  console.log(`Speed: ${rmcPacket.speed} knots, Heading: ${rmcPacket.trackTrue} degrees`);
  console.log(`Date: ${rmcPacket.date}, Time: ${rmcPacket.time}`);
} else {
  console.log("Unknown packet type:", packet.type);
}
```
